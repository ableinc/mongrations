# Mongrations
![alt text](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/database.png "Mongrations Logo")
A migrations tool for Python 3.6+. Mongrations started as a MongoDB migrations tool but has introduced MySQL & Postgres
as compatible databases for the Mongrations tool.

# Getting Started
1 . Generate a migration file
```bash
mongrations -C true --name insert-into-members
```
2 . Contents of the generated migration file (*import and class definition are 
autogenerated for migration file* - **contents of up() and down() are user defined**.)
```python
from mongrations import Mongrations, Database
from pydotenv import load_env

load_env()
# This is a MongoDB example. Go to /examples directory
# for more examples

class Mongration(Database):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Database, self).__init__()

    def up(self):
        collection = self.db['members']
        data = {
            'accountId': 1,
            'username': 'admin',
            'email': 'admin@able.digital',
            'firstName': 'Site',
            'lastName': 'Owner'
        }
        collection.insert_one(data)

    def down(self):
        collection = self.db['members']
        collection.delete_one({'username': 'admin'})


Mongrations(Mongration, 'sync')
```
3 . Run migrations
```bash
mongrations -M true
```

# Install
```bash
pip install --upgrade mongrations
```
or install locally
```bash
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```

# Use
Mongrations comes with a CLI Tool as well as a class for a pythonic migration approach. PyMongo, PyMySQL & Psycopg2 are used under
the hood, so follow <a href="https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html#getting-a-collection">PyMongo</a>'s,
<a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL">PyMySQL</a>'s, or <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">Psycopg2</a>'s documentation 
for instructions on how to create your migrations. For the environment variable tool used in this application, follow 
<a href='https://github.com/ableinc/pydotenvs'>this repo</a> (its also installed with this package).
